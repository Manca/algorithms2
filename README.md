# Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2
Stanford's Coursera course on algorithms, part 2. It can be taken here: https://class.coursera.org/algo2-004/

Like my previous repo on Part I of this course (https://github.com/Manca/algorithms1), this one will contain solutions to the programming assignments posted throughout the course. As before, they'll be coded in C++11. Feel free to comment, or give your opinion of the code - pull requests and tickets are always available/welcome.

Let's do some coding now...

## Problems
1) Greedy algorithms
   - Scheduling problem
   - Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm

2) Greedy algorithms 2
