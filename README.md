# Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Manca/algorithms2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Manca/algorithms2)

Stanford's Coursera course on algorithms, part 2. It can be taken here: https://class.coursera.org/algo2-004/

Like my previous repo on Part I of this course (https://github.com/Manca/algorithms1), this one will contain solutions to the programming assignments posted throughout the course. As before, they'll be coded in C++11. Feel free to comment, or give your opinion of the code - pull requests and tickets are always available/welcome.

Let's do some coding now...

## Problems
1) Greedy algorithms
   - Scheduling problem
   - Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm

2) Greedy algorithms 2
   - Clustering
   - Clustering big - Hamming distance
   
3) Dynamic Programming
   - Knapsack
   - Knapsack big:

     a) Recursive with memoization (hash table)

	 b) Iterative with two C-like arrays

4) Dynamic Programming 2
   - Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs Shortest Path Algorithm

5) Traveling Salesman Problem

6) 2-SAT Problem
